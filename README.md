A TypeScript type definition library for the **Kick.com API**, providing strongly typed interfaces and route definitions
for Kick’s public API. This project aims to make interacting with the Kick API easier by providing accurate and
structured TypeScript typings for developers.

## 🚀 Status: Work in Progress

This project is **unfinished and actively under development**. While we have started defining types for major Kick API
routes, **many endpoints are still incomplete**.

We welcome **contributions** from the community to help improve, refine, and expand the typings.

## 📌 Goals

- Provide **fully typed** interfaces for all Kick API endpoints
- Maintain **strict type safety** for request and response payloads
- Follow **best practices** for TypeScript API typings
- Ensure compatibility with **REST API clients** like Axios and Fetch
- Keep the types **up to date** as Kick updates their API
